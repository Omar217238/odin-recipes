    <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions,
    but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:</p>
    <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before
    forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per
    side.</p>
    <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic
